# AOC2024

Solutions to the 2024 Advent of Code

> Advent of Code (AoC) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for
a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you
like. AoC is created and designed by Eric Wastl and can be found at
https://adventofcode.com/2024/

This project will be updated as I have time to generate solutions. This should
not be used as a reference implementation.

## Usage

Solutions can be tested or executed using the `aoc2024` module directly:

    > python3 -m aoc2024 --help

or if your system installs "scripts"

    > aoc2024 --help

Specify the day and part on the command line to execute that solution. Add the
`--test` flag to test the solution. See the help for specifics.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.12 or later.

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/therealzanfar/aoc2024.git
